Data Analysis Conclusions:
- Airbnb's annual revenue experiences both peak and off-peak seasons. In July and December, due to the Independence Day and Christmas holidays in the United States, a large number of people travel, resulting in peak monthly earnings. January, on the other hand, records the lowest profitability, likely due to the end of the Christmas holiday period and a significant decrease in the number of travelers as people return to work.
- There is significant price variation for Airbnb listings within the same city, with the highest price potentially being 200% higher than the lowest price.
- Airbnb prices are positively correlated with the number of bedrooms, with a higher number of bedrooms leading to higher prices. The average price for a 6-bedroom Airbnb is $584.8, while a 1-bedroom Airbnb averages $96.2. However, when the cost is divided among multiple bedrooms, the per-bedroom cost is slightly lower than that of a single bedroom. Therefore, if privacy is a priority, renting a single bedroom may be preferable, as the cost difference is not significant.
- The Airbnb market in Seattle is predominantly composed of listings with one or two bedrooms, with very few listings having five or more bedrooms. This suggests that apartments and small houses are more prevalent.
- Based on market conditions, if considering entering the Airbnb market, it is advisable to focus on apartments and small houses. Renting out large houses may not necessarily meet the needs of users.
